# A Guide to Couchbase Lite Versioning

For version 2.0 we have yet again changed the way we are going to do our CI going forward.  This is because the old way was causing too many manual steps and slowing down the process for us.  The structure of the version numbers going forward will be the same, except with the small change that patch numbers are now going to be included even if they are 0:

> |Major|.|Minor|.|Patch|\[.|Hotfix|\]\[-b|BuildNum|] (X.Y.Z.A-b####)

Major, minor, patch, and hotfix are self-explanatory, and BuildNum is just an increasing count of builds generated by the CI server.  If a build fails, that number is skipped.

For 2.x our continuous integration server is no longer public.  The reason for this is that we expect to be making biweekly pushes to our developer feed (http://nuget.mobile.couchbase.com/nuget/Developer/) which include the most stable bits from the past two weeks.  All of the packages on the developer feed will be of the version form X.Y.Z-db###.  DB in this case stands for developer build, and the numbers after will simply increase by one for each release.  Due to a change in build and QE strategy, we will be "promoting" builds from now on from our internal feeds without any changes to the actual binaries.  This has the side effect of the internal version (i.e. version in the logs) and the version in the Windows right click properties menu under details showing up in the form X.Y.Z-b#### (i.e. the build number it received when it was built).  This is intentional, so don't worry.  This ensures that once a build has received whatever validation it needs, that it is shipped bit for bit as is.
