### Library Version

<!-- What version of the library is installed on your project from Nuget.  Also, what build number
is shown in the log output?  Text logging can be enabled via the `EnableTextLogging()` API in the
support assembly

Example:
2.0.0-db023 (Build/636)
-->

### .NET Runtime

<!-- One of the following:
.NET Core <version>
UWP <version>
Xamarin Android <version>
Xamarin iOS <version>
-->

### Operating System / Device Details

<!--
e.g. Windows 10 Fall Creator's Update, macOS 10.13.2, iOS 11.3, etc

The OS of your DEPLOYMENT device, not necessarily the build machine OS (i.e. if you are using Xamarin,
this is the iOS or Android OS)
-->

### Log Output

<!-- By default binary logs will be located in the database default directory in a folder called "Logs".  The
filename is in the format log-<unixTimestamp>.  If text logging is enabled, that is also acceptable. Please
attach a file rather than pasting inline -->

### Expected behavior

<!-- What should have happened?  Sometimes differing expectations are the cause of the issue -->

### Actual behavior

<!-- What happened instead? -->

### Steps To Reproduce

<!-- Please be as specific as possible, as if you needed to write an algorithm that performed the task -->

1. 
2. 
3. 

### Reproduction Project

<!-- Please attach a project that reproduces the behavior quickly and reliably.  This is optional,
but it very greatly speeds up the time it takes to resolve the issue.  If you have privacy concerns,
you can encrypt files with the PGP key at the root of this repo -->
